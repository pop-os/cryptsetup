cryptsetup (2:2.3.3-3+exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  This release adds a new binary package 'cryptsetup-suspend' which brings
  support to suspend encrypted LUKS devices before the system goes to sleep
  (via ACPI S3 system suspend). In other words, the encryption keys for
  LUKS devices are removed automatically from system memory before system
  suspend. After system resume, LUKS devices will be unlocked again and
  the user may be asked to provide a passphrase if required.

  See the cryptsetup-suspend(7) manpage for more information.
